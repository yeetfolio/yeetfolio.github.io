# Basically, memes.

This is the place where all my memes will go. It's a part of my [site](https://yeetssite.github.io), and how it works is some github pages magic (shown below):

1. create a new repository of any name
2. go to settings
3. go to github pages
4. under "branches and deployment", deploy from the main branch
5. create an `index.html` and your page's cotent (cotent patent pending).
6. your page will be published at your site's address, followed by "/[reponame]/"

Here's an example of what an url could look like if you had uploaded to your sites repo vs. setting up a new one:

upload (includes `.html` file extension)
